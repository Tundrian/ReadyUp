                <h2 class="details-name">Ratchet & Clank (2016)</h2>
                <p class="details-description">A game about the adventures of Cosmic fennec Ratchet and his friend and ally, the robot Clank, whom Ratchet carries behind him in his satchel.
                    Ratchet wants to be a space ranger, and he gets a chance to show that he deserves it. The missions look very serious, Ratchet himself is very serious - but this is a game, and one of its main features is humour and an elegant parody.
                    The game corresponds to the canon of the genre, but always offers something that makes every mission and every decision fresh. For example, a mission in which it is necessary to steal weapons technology from an enemy planet - to execute it, you need to knock out as many brains as possible from giant flying octopuses. Why? Because these brains can exchange the necessary technology from one local scientist, who needs brains for the experiments, but the boss does not give it to him.
                    The gameplay consists of destroying enemies in a variety of unexpected ways, with weapons of fourteen kinds, and among them a shotgun that turns enemies into pixel pictures and then crushes them into pixels. There are a lot of such finds in the game. In addition to shooting, there are chases and other things. And besides weapons - a lot of useful original devices.</p>
